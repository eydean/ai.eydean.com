							<h1>What exactly is AIaaS and how is Eydean different</h1>
							<p>Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) is basically third-party offering of artificial intelligence outsourcing. So, people get to take advantage AI without spending too much money, investing in the same and at a much lower level of risk involved.
							There are several AI provider platforms which present different forms of Machine Learning as well as AI. These variations can be used by different organizations and this will help them ascertain their need for AI and whether AI works for them or not. There are some Cloud AI service providers which provide specialized hardware required for few AI tasks, such as GPU based processing for intensive workloads etc. Buying such hardware and software can be too costly in the beginning. So AIaaS seems to be a solution for a lot of organizations.

							In past few years, several huge IT firms such as Google (Cloud Platform), Amazon (Web Services), Microsoft (Azure) and IBM (Developer Cloud) and some startups such as BigML, Dataiku, ForecastThis have begun to provide Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS).

							This is done to trim down entry costs which other companies have to pay if they wish to use AI.

							How AIaaS began?
							Even though the concept of Artificial Intelligence has been doing rounds since 1960’s, progress in graphics processing units as well as networking, together with a need for big data, has put the same into the focus of several companies.

							Due to a sudden increase in data from various applications as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and a requirement for real-time decision making, Artificial Intelligence is fast becoming a main prerequisite and differentiator for several cloud providers.

							AI consists of wide array of algorithms which facilitate solving of specific tasks by computers. This is achieved by doing a general analysis of data.

							In the past, companies needed a lot of money, as well as time to build up infrastructure and technical, know-how for AI applications.

							Now, AIaaS has minimized the development time. So, basically, you get AI off the shelf as per your need. AIaaS enables everyone, regardless of how much knowledge they possess, to take benefit of AI. For the developers clean APIs are given, the users get coding skills graphical user interfaces together with detailed instructions in order to ensure data processing pipeline.



							By leveraging several AI cloud services, companies can come up with solutions to offer the answer to an endless list of multifaceted problems.
<ul>
							<li>We’re going to harness artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how we interact with the ambient computing, the agents, in our lives.</li>
							<li>We’re going to infuse every application that we interact with, on any device, at any point in time, with intelligence.</li>
							<li>We’ll make these same intelligent capabilities that are infused in our own apps — the cognitive capabilities — available to every application developer in the world.</li>
							<li>We’re building the world’s most powerful AI supercomputer and making it available to anyone, via the cloud, to enable all to harness its power and tackle AI challenges, large and small.</li>
